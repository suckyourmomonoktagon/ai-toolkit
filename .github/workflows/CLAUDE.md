# GitHub Actions Workflows

## Purpose

Contains GitHub Actions workflow definitions that automate CI/CD, code quality, releases, and Claude AI integrations for the AI Toolkit monorepo. Includes both callable workflows (prefixed with `_`) and consumer workflows that use them.

## Recent Changes

- `ci-check-pr-title.yml` runs the semantic pull-request action only for
  `pull_request_target` events. The title-generation workflow's
  `workflow_run` event is reported as a successful skip because that action
  cannot infer a pull request from that event type.

## Workflow Categories

### CI & Quality Assurance (2 workflows)

- `ci-pr-checks.yml` - Validates PRs with build, lint, format, test, and plugin validation checks
- `claude-welcome.yml` - Posts welcome messages from Claude to new PRs

### Release & Deployment (2 workflows)

- `publish-packages.yml` - Unified package publishing workflow (automatic on push to main/next, manual via workflow_dispatch). Also detects changes to reusable workflows and syncs them to the `next` branch with Slack notifications.

**Authentication Methods:**

You can authenticate with Claude using either method:

1. **API Key (Traditional):** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your Anthropic API key
2. **OAuth Token (Pro/Max Users):** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with a token generated via `claude setup-token`

If both are provided, OAuth token takes precedence. At least one authentication method must be configured.

> **Important:** The [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) must be installed on your repository for these workflows to function. This is required by Anthropic's official Claude Code GitHub Action.

**Configuration Inputs:**

| Input                           | Required | Default                                                 | Description                                                         |

| `plugin_marketplaces`           | No       | `""`                                                    | Additional marketplace paths (newline-separated, local or Git URLs) |
| `plugins`                       | No       | `""`                                                    | Additional plugins to install (newline-separated)                   |
| `install_uniswap_plugins`       | No       | `true`                                                  | Auto-install uniswap-ai-toolkit plugins (false to opt out)          |
| `exclude_plugins`               | No       | `uniswap-integrations`, `spec-workflow`, `claude-setup` | Newline-separated plugin names to exclude from auto-installation    |

**Plugin Configuration:**

All Uniswap AI Toolkit plugins are **automatically installed** by default for every workflow invocation. Plugins are discovered dynamically from `marketplace.json` at runtime — no action update needed when new plugins are added to the marketplace.

**Default exclusions:** `uniswap-integrations`, `spec-workflow`, and `claude-setup` are excluded by default (these are optional/specialized plugins not needed by most callers). Set `exclude_plugins: ""` to install all marketplace plugins.

**How it works:**

The `build-plugin-config` action fetches `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from the ai-toolkit repo (always from the default `main` branch), then installs all plugins except those listed in `exclude_plugins`. The Git URL `https://github.com/Uniswap/ai-toolkit.git` is registered as the marketplace source.

**Opt-out:** Set `install_uniswap_plugins: false` to disable automatic plugin installation. Use this when you want to use only your own plugins.

You can use the `plugin_marketplaces` and `plugins` inputs to install **additional** plugins beyond the auto-discovered set (or as the only plugins when `install_uniswap_plugins: false`).

> **Note:** Plugin support requires claude-code-action v1.0.29+.

**Usage example (API Key):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-main.yml@main
with:
  model: 'claude-sonnet-5'
  custom_instructions: |
    Focus on code quality and security.
    Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines.
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**Usage example (OAuth Token):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-main.yml@main
with:
  model: 'claude-sonnet-5'
secrets:
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

**Usage example (Both - OAuth takes precedence):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-main.yml@main
with:
  model: 'claude-sonnet-5'
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

### PR Code Review (`_claude-code-review.yml`)

> **Scope note:** this is the **reusable workflow published for other repositories**. It is fully supported and everything documented below still applies to callers. It is _not_ what ai-toolkit uses to review its own PRs — that moved to `@uniswap/review-cli`. See [PR Code Review for this repository](#pr-code-review-for-this-repository-claude-code-reviewyml).
>
> When changing this workflow, `build-prompt.ts`, `post-review.ts`, or `.github/prompts/pr-review/`, remember that ai-toolkit's own CI no longer exercises them. External consumers pin by commit SHA, so a regression here will not surface on an ai-toolkit PR — validate against a consumer repo (or `Uniswap/ai-sandbox`) before merging.

This workflow performs automated PR code reviews using Claude AI with the following features:

**Key Features:**

- Formal GitHub reviews (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT)
- Inline comments on specific lines of code (as `github-actions[bot]`)
- **Real-time status updates**: Shows "review in progress" immediately when workflow starts
- **Accurate diff calculation**: Uses the merge base (common ancestor) to compute diffs, matching exactly what GitHub shows in the PR view even when the base branch has moved forward
- Patch-ID based caching to skip rebases (no actual code changes)
- **Comment trigger**: Add `@request-claude-review` to any PR comment to force a fresh review
- Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch to force a new review (bypasses cache)
- **Modular prompt architecture**: Prompts assembled from section files using `build-prompt.ts` (with unit tests)
- Existing review comment context for re-reviews
- Fast review mode for trivial PRs (< 20 lines)
- **Lockfile exclusion**: Auto-generated lockfiles are excluded from the diff (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, bun.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, Podfile.lock, etc.)
- **Built-in Verdict Decision Rules** - Ensures consistent, predictable review verdicts
- **Debug artifacts**: Uploads PR diff files and final assembled prompt as GitHub Actions artifacts for debugging
- **Auto-fix mode**: Optionally auto-fix issues and push changes, triggering a re-review

**Verdict Decision Rules:**

The workflow includes mandatory verdict decision rules that ensure Claude returns appropriate review verdicts:

| Verdict             | When to Use                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **APPROVE**         | No bugs or security issues found. Suggestions, questions, and style feedback are NOT blocking.                                  |
| **REQUEST_CHANGES** | Bugs, security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks, or breaking changes found.                                               |
| **COMMENT**         | Used sparingly when multiple near-blocking issues exist or significant rework is needed, but no specific bug can be identified. |

**Key principle:** Questions, considerations, "nice-to-haves", and teaching moments are NOT blocking issues. If Claude's review is positive overall with suggestions, it should APPROVE, not COMMENT.

This logic is built into the workflow's system prompt, so all consumers get consistent verdict behavior regardless of their custom prompt content. Custom prompts should focus on _how to review_ (priorities, tone, patterns to look for), not _how to decide the verdict_.

**Architecture:**

This workflow uses a hybrid approach with testable TypeScript components:

1. A TypeScript script (`build-prompt.ts`) assembles the prompt from modular section files and writes it to a temp file
2. Claude receives a file reference (`@/tmp/final-prompt.txt`) and reads the prompt from disk
3. Claude analyzes the PR and outputs structured JSON
4. A TypeScript script (`post-review.ts`) parses the JSON and posts the review via `gh` CLI

**Why file reference instead of direct prompt passing?**

Large prompts (big diffs, many existing comments) can cause parsing issues when passed through GitHub Actions outputs to Bun. By writing the prompt to a file and using Claude Code's `@path` reference syntax, we avoid:

- GitHub Actions output size limitations
- Bun's string parsing issues with large heredoc content
- Shell escaping problems with complex prompt content

This architecture ensures:

- All comments appear as `github-actions[bot]` using the official Anthropic action
- Prompt building logic is testable (see `.github/scripts/build-prompt.spec.ts`)
- External repos can use the workflow by downloading scripts from ai-toolkit
- Large prompts are handled reliably regardless of content size

**Real-Time Status Updates:**

The workflow provides immediate feedback to PR authors:

| Status                  | When Shown                                            | Message                                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 **In Progress**      | Immediately when workflow starts                      | "Claude is currently analyzing this pull request..." |
| ✅ **No Review Needed** | When cache hit detected (rebase with no code changes) | "No new code changes since the last review"          |
| 📋 **Review Complete**  | After Claude finishes analysis                        | Full review with verdict and inline comments         |

This eliminates the "is it running?" uncertainty by posting a status comment as the very first action in the workflow, before any analysis begins. The same comment is then updated with the final review or skipped status.

**Debug Artifacts:**

The workflow uploads several artifacts for debugging and inspection (retained for 7 days):

| Artifact Name                   | Contents                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pr-diff-files-pr{N}`           | Changed files list (`changed-files.txt`) and PR diff (`pr-diff.txt`)       |
| `final-prompt-pr{N}`            | The fully assembled prompt sent to Claude (`final-prompt.txt`)             |
| `claude-execution-output-pr{N}` | Raw Claude execution output JSON                                           |
| `post-review-debug-pr{N}`       | JSON payloads sent to GitHub API by post-review script (`gh-input-*.json`) |

These artifacts are available in the workflow run's "Artifacts" section and are useful for:

- Debugging prompt assembly issues
- Verifying which files were included in the diff
- Inspecting Claude's raw output when reviews behave unexpectedly
- Debugging GitHub API call failures (inspect the exact JSON payloads sent)

**Required Secrets:**

| Secret                    | Required                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | Yes (unless `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set) | Anthropic API key for Claude access                                                                                                                                                 |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | No (alternative to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)       | Claude Code OAuth token for authentication. When provided, takes precedence over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Generate with `claude setup-token`.                                           |
| `WORKFLOW_PAT`            | No                                            | Personal Access Token with `repo` scope. Needed for resolving review threads via GraphQL API and for pushing auto-fix commits (falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` but auto-fix may fail). |

**Authentication Methods:**

You can authenticate with Claude using either method:

1. **API Key (Traditional):** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your Anthropic API key
2. **OAuth Token (Pro/Max Users):** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with a token generated via `claude setup-token`

If both are provided, OAuth token takes precedence. At least one authentication method must be configured.

> **Important:** The [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) must be installed on your repository for these workflows to function. This is required by Anthropic's official Claude Code GitHub Action.
>
> **Note:** If you need assistance installing the Claude GitHub App, please open an issue at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Uniswap/ai-toolkit/issues).

**Repository Settings (Required):**

You must enable GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests:

1. Go to your repository's **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Scroll to **"Workflow permissions"**
3. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
4. Click **Save**

> **Why this is needed:** The Claude Code Review workflow submits formal GitHub reviews (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT). Without this setting enabled, the workflow cannot post review verdicts.

**Configuration Inputs:**

| Input                                 | Required | Default                                                 | Description                                                                                                                    |

**Section Overrides (Granular Prompt Customization):**

The PR review prompt is assembled from modular section files in `.github/prompts/pr-review/`. You can selectively override specific sections using `prompt_override_*` inputs. Each input points to a markdown file in your repository containing the replacement content.

| Input                                 | Section File Replaced                  | Default Behavior                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt_override_files_to_skip`       | `overridable/5-files-to-skip.md`       | Lockfiles, snapshots, build artifacts, generated code |
| `prompt_override_review_priorities`   | `overridable/4-review-priorities.md`   | Critical (bugs/security) → Maintainability → Style    |
| `prompt_override_communication_style` | `overridable/6-communication-style.md` | Direct, specific, with code examples                  |
| `prompt_override_pattern_recognition` | `overridable/7-pattern-recognition.md` | Common antipatterns, dependency injection patterns    |

**Section Override Example:**

Create markdown files in your repository:

`.claude/prompts/review-files-to-skip.md`:

```markdown
## Files to Skip

**Project-specific exclusions:**

- `*.generated.ts` - Auto-generated TypeScript
- `**/migrations/**` - Database migrations
- `src/contracts/abis/*.json` - Contract ABIs
```

`.claude/prompts/review-priorities.md`:

```markdown
## Review Priorities

### Critical (Security Focus)

- Smart contract interactions
- Token approval patterns
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities

### Standard

- Business logic correctness
- Error handling
```

Then reference them in your workflow:

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-code-review.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  prompt_override_files_to_skip: '.claude/prompts/review-files-to-skip.md'
  prompt_override_review_priorities: '.claude/prompts/review-priorities.md'
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }}
```

**Notes:**

- Override files must exist in the repository; missing files will cause an error
- Each override file should contain properly formatted markdown for that section

**Usage example (API Key):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-code-review.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  base_ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  model: 'claude-sonnet-5'
  toolkit_ref: 'main' # or 'next' to test unreleased changes
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }}
```

**Usage example (OAuth Token):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-code-review.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  base_ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  model: 'claude-sonnet-5'
secrets:
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
  WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }}
```

**Testing Unreleased Changes:**

Use the `toolkit_ref` input to test changes to the post-review script before merging:

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-code-review.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  base_ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  toolkit_ref: 'next' # Use the 'next' branch version of post-review.ts
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**Usage example (with auto-fix enabled):**

When `auto_fix` is enabled, Claude will automatically attempt to fix issues found in the review and push the changes to the PR branch. This triggers a new push event, which runs a fresh review of the fixed code.

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-code-review.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  base_ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  auto_fix: true # Enable automatic fixing of issues
  auto_fix_model: 'claude-opus-5' # Use Opus for better fixes (optional)
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }} # Required for pushing fixes
```

> **Note:** `WORKFLOW_PAT` is required for auto-fix to push commits. Without it, the workflow will fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` which may lack push permissions for PRs from forks.

**Auto-Fix Behavior:**

| Review Outcome       | Auto-Fix Action                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REQUEST_CHANGES`    | Claude attempts to fix all identified issues               |
| `COMMENT` (w/issues) | Claude attempts to fix issues mentioned in inline comments |
| `APPROVE`            | No auto-fix needed (no issues found)                       |

After pushing fixes, a new workflow run is triggered automatically, which will re-review the updated code. The `max_auto_fix_cycles` input controls how many consecutive review→fix rounds are allowed (default: 1). The count tracks consecutive auto-fix commits from HEAD, so a human commit resets the counter and allows fresh auto-fix cycles.

**Triggering a New Review Without Code Changes:**

The easiest way to trigger a fresh Claude review is to add a comment containing `@request-claude-review` to the PR. This works with both regular PR comments and inline review comments.

> **Note:** Re-requesting a review from `github-actions[bot]` via the GitHub UI does **NOT** work. GitHub does not fire the `review_requested` event when re-requesting reviews from bot accounts. Use the comment trigger or manual workflow_dispatch instead.

**When to trigger a new review:**

- After addressing review comments without pushing new code
- After infrastructure changes (e.g., updated prompts, new model)
- When a previous review timed out or encountered errors
- When you want a fresh perspective on unchanged code

**Option 1: Comment Trigger (Easiest)**

Simply add a comment to the PR containing `@request-claude-review`:

```text
@request-claude-review
```

This triggers a fresh review, bypassing the cache. Works in:

- Regular PR comments
- Inline review comments (comments on specific lines of code)

**Option 2: Manual Trigger via workflow_dispatch**

**Via GitHub CLI:**

```bash
# Trigger a forced review for PR #123
gh workflow run "Claude Code Review" -f pr_number=123

# Trigger without forcing (will respect cache)
gh workflow run "Claude Code Review" -f pr_number=123 -f force_review=false
```

**Via GitHub UI:**

1. Navigate to Actions → Claude Code Review
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the PR number
4. Optionally toggle `force_review` (defaults to `true`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

When `force_review` is `true`, the workflow bypasses the patch-ID cache and runs a complete review even if the same code was previously reviewed.

### PR Code Review for this repository (`claude-code-review.yml`)

This is how ai-toolkit reviews its **own** PRs. It runs [`@uniswap/review-cli`](https://github.com/Uniswap/internal-tools/tree/main/packages/review-cli) from `Uniswap/internal-tools` and deliberately does **not** call `_claude-code-review.yml`.

**Why the two coexist:** `_claude-code-review.yml` is a published product with 10+ external consumers pinned to it by commit SHA. It stays. This repo simply consumes the shared reviewer that `Uniswap/universe` and `Uniswap/backend` already use, so improvements to review quality land in one place instead of three.

**Architecture — two jobs plus three supporting jobs:**

| Job                     | Runs when                                       | Does                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `check-automated`       | `pull_request` only                             | Classifies automated PRs via the shared `check-automated-pr` action (title + branch)     |
| `triage`                | Gate passes                                     | `review-cli triage` decides run/skip, resolves the PR number, fork check, 👀 ack + reply |
| `review`                | `triage.run == true` and not a fork             | Installs the CLI + Claude binary, then `review` (analyze) followed by `post` (write)     |
| `review-skipped`        | Automated PR that isn't a dependency PR         | Emits a `::notice::` so the run explains itself                                          |
| `auto-merge-dependabot` | Dependabot security/bump PR after a good review | Enables squash auto-merge                                                                |

**The analyze/post split matters.** `review-cli review` reads the diff, runs the agents, and persists `last-run.json`. The analyze pipeline is never handed a GitHub writer, so `review-cli post` is the only verb that writes review _state_ (findings, thread resolutions, the sticky). The `react`/`reply` steps also write to the PR, but only reactions and the trigger reply. They are separate workflow steps, and `post` runs on `success() || failure()` so a partial analyze still publishes what it found.

That split is a property of **the CLI**, not of the job's credentials. The `review` job declares `contents: write` (required by the `resolveReviewThread` mutation), so `GITHUB_TOKEN` during Analyze _is_ write-capable and the agent has Bash access. Do not cite the analyze/post split as evidence that the fork guard is redundant.

**Gotcha — the `review` job's tooling must come from the trusted ref, not the PR head.** The `review` job checks out `refs/pull/N/head` because that is the content under analysis. Everything that _acts on_ that content is checked out separately from the default ref into `.review-tooling/`, and the job then replaces the workspace `.claude` with the trusted copy. Two independent reasons:

1. **Availability.** A local `uses: ./.github/actions/...` resolves out of the checked-out workspace. Any PR branched before `install_review_cli` landed does not contain it, so resolving the installer from the PR head fails with `Can't find 'action.yml'` on every open PR until it rebases.
2. **Trust.** The job holds `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and a `contents: write` token, and the agent's prompts _are_ `.claude/agents/*.md`. Sourcing the installer shell or the agent set from the head branch lets a PR author rewrite both. Note that `.github/actions/**` is **not** covered by the `workflow` token scope that guards `.github/workflows/**`, so that gate does not help.

Two mechanics that are easy to get wrong:

- **`ref:` must be explicit.** Omitting `ref:` does **not** mean "the default branch". `actions/checkout` falls back to `GITHUB_SHA`, which on a `pull_request` event is the _merge commit_ (base + head) and on `issue_comment` / `workflow_dispatch` is the default branch. An unpinned "trusted" checkout is therefore head-influenced on exactly the trigger that matters most. The trusted checkout pins `ref: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}`.
- **Order matters.** The trusted checkout must come **after** the PR-head checkout, because `actions/checkout` runs `git clean -ffdx` on its target and a workspace-root checkout running second would delete `.review-tooling/`.

The `triage` job's checkout is deliberately **not** pinned this way. It holds no `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and runs no agent, so the worst case is a PR altering its own review eligibility rather than executing code with a credential. Note that the fork guard in that job deliberately does not read config — it resolves the head repo through the API — so it cannot be disabled from the PR branch.

**Consequence, and it is intended:** edits to `.claude/review.yml` or `.claude/agents/*` take effect only once merged. A PR cannot review itself with a reviewer set it wrote. Iterate locally with `review-cli dev` rather than pushing a commit per change. There is no flag to point the CLI at a config outside the repo root — `loadConfig(repoRoot)` takes only a root — which is why the fix is a file copy rather than an argument.

A corollary worth knowing before you debug it: the `review` job **cannot succeed on the PR that introduces the tooling**, because the trusted ref does not have `.claude/` or `install_review_cli` yet. The `Use trusted review config` guard fails by design, and the job goes red until that PR merges. Every PR after the bootstrap gets the real path.

**The trusted checkout must stay invisible to git, or every review silently degrades.** review-cli gates its full-checkout fast path on `git status --porcelain` being empty (`gitIsWorkingTreeClean`, which counts untracked paths). `.review-tooling/` lives inside `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and is untracked, so left as-is the tree reads dirty on **every** run and the CLI falls back to extracting only the files the diff touched, with no `.git`. Agents keep working and the run stays green, but they lose whole-repo `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` and all git history.

That hits the two reviewers this repo adds hardest, because both are told to look outside the diff: `plugin-conventions-reviewer` globs `skills/` directories a diff never touches, and `workflow-security-reviewer` greps sibling workflows for the same action pinned at an older SHA. Neither would announce the loss.

Two mitigations, both needed:

- `echo '/.review-tooling/' >> .git/info/exclude` hides the untracked tooling directory.
- `echo '/.claude/' >> .git/info/exclude` for the files the trusted copy lands that are **not tracked at the PR head** — every `.claude/**` file added after that branch was cut. `git diff --name-only` never lists untracked paths, so the next mitigation structurally cannot reach these. This one bites hardest on the merge of the PR that introduces `.claude/` at all, because every already-open PR then gets `??` entries.
- `git update-index --assume-unchanged` on the `.claude` paths the trusted copy reverted. `.git/info/exclude` cannot hide **tracked** files, and swapping in the trusted `.claude` makes any PR that edits `.claude/**` dirty — which would re-trigger the fallback for exactly the PRs most likely to be tuning the reviewers.

The step ends by asserting `git status --porcelain` is empty and warns if it is not, because the failure is otherwise undetectable from the outside.

**A second-order consequence of making that work, accepted deliberately.** review-cli's post-synthesis `verifyFindings` pass is gated on `workspaceShape == 'working-tree'`, so it was effectively dead in this repo's CI while the tree was always dirty. With the tree clean it runs, and it resolves cited files from the workspace — where `.claude` is now the pre-PR copy. On a PR that _adds_ a `.claude/**` file, a finding against that file is dropped as "file not readable at HEAD"; on one that lengthens a file, a finding past the trusted copy's EOF is dropped as "beyond file end". Both drops are logged rather than silent, and only reviewer-tuning PRs can reach them. Do not "fix" this by skipping the swap: that hands config and agent prompts back to the PR author, which is the trust inversion the swap exists to close. A real carve-out needs an upstream change.

**Steps that shell out to the CLI are gated on `steps.install-review-cli.outputs.bin-path != ''`.** That output is empty whenever the install step never ran, which is exactly what happens when an earlier step fails. Without the gate, `Post` and the reaction/reply steps still execute, resolve `"$REVIEW_CLI_BIN/review-cli"` to `/review-cli`, and fail with exit 127 — replacing the real error in the log with a meaningless one.

**Gotcha — the `triage` gate must read `.claude/review.yml`.** review-cli's upstream workflow template runs the gate with `--skip-config` to avoid a checkout. Do not copy that here. `--skip-config` passes **no** policy, which is not the same as "the CLI's built-in defaults":

- `skip.drafts` falls back to `true`, which would skip the `claude[bot]` draft PRs the autonomous-task workflow opens
- branch and author skips are not applied at all

So the `triage` job does a sparse checkout of `.github/actions` and `.claude`, and runs the gate **without** `--skip-config`. A `Verify review config is present` step fails the job if `.claude/review.yml` is missing, because `loadConfig` treats a missing file as "use defaults" and logs nothing — a botched checkout would otherwise silently stop reviewing dependency PRs, breaking auto-merge on a green run.

**Configuration lives in the repo, not in workflow inputs:**

| `.claude/agents/*-reviewer.md`       | Repo-specific reviewers, **added to** review-cli's bundled set (not replacing it)                                                                   |
| `.github/actions/install_review_cli` | Installs the CLI from GitHub Packages into an isolated `$RUNNER_TEMP` dir. In the `review` job it is resolved from the trusted ref, not the PR head |
| `vars.REVIEW_CLI_VERSION`            | CLI version override; falls back to the pin in the workflow. Never `@latest`                                                                        |
| `secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`    | **Required.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is deliberately never forwarded to the review job                                                                 |
| `secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY`            | Optional. Enables CI Visibility stamping; the step is skipped when unset                                                                            |

**Repo-specific reviewers.** review-cli ships 11 bundled agents: security, correctness, patterns, dependency-upgrade, and general reviewers; contract-security and defi-risk reviewers (neither applicable here, see `triage.guidance`); stack-security-analyst and stack-synthesis for stacked PRs; plus triage and synthesis. ai-toolkit adds two:

- `workflow-security-reviewer` — expression injection into `run:` blocks, unpinned or dynamically-referenced actions, permission scope, missing Bullfrog steps, secret exposure through logs and artifacts, `fromJSON` coercion of `vars.*`, and breaking changes to the reusable-workflow contracts other repos depend on.
- `plugin-conventions-reviewer` — the mandatory `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version bump and its increment, manifest arrays drifting from the directories on disk, skills registered as commands, and skill/agent naming conventions.

`triage.guidance` in `.claude/review.yml` tells triage never to staff `contract-security-reviewer` or `defi-risk-reviewer` — this repo has no Solidity.

**Gotcha — the Analyze timeout is step-level on purpose.** The `review` job has `timeout-minutes: 25` as a hard ceiling, but a job-level timeout **cancels** the job, and a cancelled run matches neither `success()` nor `failure()` (only `always()` and `cancelled()`). An overrun would therefore skip `Post` entirely, leaving the `--pre` sticky stuck on "⏳ Review running" while the `always()` reaction step flips to ❌. The `Analyze` step carries its own `timeout-minutes: 17` so an overrun becomes a _failure_, which `Post`'s gate does match. The job ceiling is 25 rather than 20 so the step ceiling always fires first: a step timeout is measured from step start and the job timeout from job start, so the tail budget is `25 - setup - 17`, not a flat 3 minutes, and setup is unbounded (Bullfrog, a `fetch-depth: 0` checkout, a GitHub Packages install, a `curl | bash`). Measured setup on a real run was 35s.

**The same cancellation distinction applies to the reaction and reply steps.** Both run under `always()`, which is the one gate that fires on cancellation, and `job.status` is `cancelled` there. Rendering that as ❌ / "Review failed" would tell a requester to retry a review their successor is about to finish, since concurrency cancels a comment-triggered run whenever a push supersedes it. The reaction step therefore carries `!cancelled()` and the reply step branches on `cancelled()` to post "Superseded" instead.

Do **not** "fix" this by widening `Post` to `always()`. Cancellation is also how the `concurrency` group stops a superseded run, and an `always()` Post would let that dying run overwrite the sticky its successor is mid-way through writing.

**Why `install_review_cli` needs an isolated directory:** the repo's `bunfig.toml` pins the whole `@uniswap` scope to `registry.npmjs.org`, but `@uniswap/review-cli` is private on GitHub Packages, and bun only supports per-_scope_ registry overrides. The same file also enforces a 3-day `minimumReleaseAge` as a supply-chain control. That age gate applies to exact version requests too, so a review-cli version published less than 3 days ago is uninstallable until it ages in (bun errors rather than downgrading; an exact pin bypasses the stability-check fallback). Installing from a scratch dir with its own `bunfig.toml` sidesteps both without touching the repo's copy.

**Behavior preserved from the previous implementation:**

- Dependency PRs are **reviewed, not skipped** (review-cli's default skip policy would skip `dependabot/`, `renovate/`, and every `*[bot]` author). `auto-merge-dependabot` gates on the review result, so skipping them would leave security bumps unmerged. Hence `skip.authors: []` and the omitted dependency branch prefixes in `.claude/review.yml`.
- Draft PRs authored by `claude[bot]` are still reviewed on open. review-cli's `skip.drafts` is a single boolean that cannot express that carve-out, so `skip.drafts` is `false` and the draft policy lives in the `triage` job's `if:` instead.
- Title-based automation detection (`chore(release):`, `chore(sync):`) is retained through `check-automated`, because review-cli's skip policy matches branches and authors but has no notion of PR titles.
- Fork PRs are never reviewed. The `review` job checks out PR head code and runs an agent with Bash access; review-cli's triage has no fork concept, and the `issue_comment` / `workflow_dispatch` payloads carry no head-repo field, so the `triage` job resolves it via the API.
- `workflow_dispatch` still accepts `pr_number` and `force_review`. `force_review` maps to `--force` (skip rebase detection), **not** `--fresh` — `--fresh` would also discard prior findings and thread decisions, losing the iterative review context.

**Triggering a review without pushing code:** comment `@request-claude-review` on the PR (works on both regular and inline review comments), or dispatch manually:

```bash
gh workflow run "Claude Code Review" -f pr_number=123
```

Comment triggers are restricted to `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, and `COLLABORATOR` associations and ignore bot authors. This is enforced both by the job-level `if:` (to avoid paying for runner startup) and authoritatively inside `review-cli triage`.

**Debugging a run:** every run uploads `review-cli-run-<pr>-<attempt>` containing the full run JSON (events, findings, verdict), retained 30 days. `agent-tokens` carries per-agent cost records for the agent-scorecard aggregator and must keep that exact artifact name. Locally, `review-cli last`, `review-cli artifact <pr>`, and `review-cli 123 --repo Uniswap/ai-toolkit --explain` are the fastest ways to inspect behavior; `--explain` prints the resolved agent plan and exits without calling any model.

### PR Documentation Validator (`_claude-docs-check.yml`)

This workflow validates that PR documentation is properly updated based on code changes. It checks CLAUDE.md files, README files, and plugin version bumps.

**Key Features:**

| Feature                     | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLAUDE.md Validation**    | Checks if CLAUDE.md files need updating when code in their scope changes           |
| **README Validation**       | Verifies README files reflect current state                                        |
| **Plugin Version Checking** | Ensures plugin versions are bumped when plugin code changes (critical for plugins) |
| **Commit Suggestions**      | Provides GitHub commit suggestions users can apply with one click                  |
| **Fixup Branch Creation**   | For larger changes, creates a fixup branch that can be merged into the PR          |
| **Auto-Commit Mode**        | Optionally auto-commit and push all suggestions directly to the PR branch          |
| **Pass/Fail Verdict**       | Returns clear pass/fail status for CI integration                                  |
| **Auto-Fix Mode**           | Optionally auto-fix documentation issues and push changes (triggers re-check)      |
| **Dual Authentication**     | Supports both API key and OAuth token authentication (OAuth takes precedence)      |

**Suggestion Modes:**

| Mode      | Description                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `suggest` | Post inline commit suggestions via PR review (default). Users click "Commit suggestion". |
| `branch`  | Create a fixup branch with all suggested changes for easy merging.                       |
| `auto`    | Use `suggest` for ≤3 suggestions, `branch` for >3 suggestions.                           |
| `check`   | Just analyze and report (no suggestions posted).                                         |

**Verdict Logic:**

| Verdict  | When Returned                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PASS** | No issues found OR only info/minor severity suggestions             |
| **FAIL** | Any error-level issues (e.g., plugin modified without version bump) |

**Required Secrets:**

| Secret                    | Required                                      | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | Yes (unless `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set) | Anthropic API key for Claude access                                                                                                       |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | No (alternative to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)       | Claude Code OAuth token for authentication. When provided, takes precedence over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Generate with `claude setup-token`. |
| `WORKFLOW_PAT`            | No                                            | Personal Access Token with `repo` scope. Needed for fixup branch creation and auto-fix push access.                                       |

**Authentication Methods:**

You can authenticate with Claude using either method:

1. **API Key (Traditional):** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your Anthropic API key
2. **OAuth Token (Pro/Max Users):** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with a token generated via `claude setup-token`

If both are provided, OAuth token takes precedence. At least one authentication method must be configured.

> **Important:** The [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) must be installed on your repository for these workflows to function. This is required by Anthropic's official Claude Code GitHub Action.

**Configuration Inputs:**

**Usage example (API Key):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-docs-check.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  suggestion_mode: 'suggest'
  fail_on_missing_version: true
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**Usage example (OAuth Token):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-docs-check.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  suggestion_mode: 'suggest'
  fail_on_missing_version: true
secrets:
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

**Usage example (with fixup branch for larger changes):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-docs-check.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  suggestion_mode: 'auto' # Uses suggest for ≤3 suggestions, branch for >3
secrets:
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
  WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }} # Required for branch creation
```

**Usage example (with auto-commit - changes pushed automatically):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-docs-check.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  auto_commit: true # Automatically commit and push all suggestions
secrets:
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
  WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }} # Required for push access
```

> **Note:** When `auto_commit: true`, the workflow will apply all suggestions directly to the PR branch and push them. This bypasses `suggestion_mode` entirely. The `WORKFLOW_PAT` secret is required for push access.

**Usage example (with auto-fix enabled):**

When `auto_fix` is enabled, if the docs check finds issues (FAIL verdict or suggestions), Claude will automatically attempt to fix them and push the changes to the PR branch. This triggers a new push event, which runs a fresh docs check.

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_claude-docs-check.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  auto_fix: true # Enable automatic fixing of documentation issues
  auto_fix_model: 'claude-opus-5' # Use Opus for better fixes (optional)
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }} # Required for pushing fixes
```

> **Note:** `WORKFLOW_PAT` is required for auto-fix to push commits. Without it, the workflow will fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` which may lack push permissions for PRs from forks.

**Auto-Fix Behavior:**

| Docs Check Result          | Auto-Fix Action                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FAIL` verdict             | Claude attempts to fix all identified documentation issues |
| `PASS` with suggestions    | Claude attempts to apply suggested improvements            |
| `PASS` with no suggestions | No auto-fix needed (no issues found)                       |

After pushing fixes, a new workflow run is triggered automatically, which will re-check the updated documentation. This creates a feedback loop until the docs pass or require manual intervention.

**What Gets Checked:**

1. **CLAUDE.md Files**: If code in a package/directory was modified, checks if the corresponding CLAUDE.md needs updating based on structural changes, new functions/classes, or changed APIs.

2. **README.md Files**: If package structure, APIs, or usage patterns changed, checks if README needs updating.

3. **Plugin Version Bumps** (Critical): If ANY file in `packages/plugins/<plugin-name>/` was modified, verifies that the plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` has its version bumped appropriately:

   - Patch bump for bug fixes
   - Minor bump for new features
   - Major bump for breaking changes

4. **Changelog Entries**: Checks if significant changes should have changelog entries (informational, not blocking).

**Debug Artifacts:**

The workflow uploads artifacts for debugging (retained for 7 days):

| Artifact Name      | Contents                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs-check-pr{N}` | Prompt file, response JSON, and changed files list |

### PR Metadata Generation (`_generate-pr-metadata.yml`)

This workflow generates PR titles and descriptions using Claude AI with the following features:

**Content Preservation with Markers:**

The workflow wraps generated descriptions in HTML comment markers to enable selective updates:

```html
<!-- claude-pr-description-start -->
... AI-generated content ...
<!-- claude-pr-description-end -->
```

**First run behavior:**

- If the PR already has a description (no markers yet), the existing content is preserved above the markers
- The AI-generated content is **appended** below the existing description, wrapped in markers
- This ensures existing PR descriptions are never lost

**Subsequent runs:**

- Content **before** `<!-- claude-pr-description-start -->` is preserved (user's prefix)
- Content **after** `<!-- claude-pr-description-end -->` is preserved (user's suffix)
- Only the content between markers is replaced with new AI-generated content

This allows users to add custom notes, disclaimers, or additional context that survives regeneration.

**Example PR body with user additions:**

```markdown
> **Note:** This PR requires manual QA testing before merge.

## <!-- claude-pr-description-start -->

## :sparkles: Claude-Generated Content

## Summary

- Added new authentication flow
- Updated user session handling
<!-- claude-pr-description-end -->

**Related Issues:** #123, #456
```

**Generation Mode:**

The `generation_mode` input is a comma-separated list that controls what the workflow generates. Combine values as needed.

| Value              | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`            | Generate and set the PR title (overwrites existing)                                |
| `description`      | Generate the PR description                                                        |
| `title-suggestion` | Include a suggested title in the description (non-intrusive, doesn't modify title) |
| `deferred-title`   | Only generate title if existing is inadequate (doesn't follow conventions)         |

**Common Combinations:**

| Combination                    | Description                                               | Default |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `description`                  | Only generate description, leave title alone              | Yes     |
| `title,description`            | Generate both title and description                       | No      |
| `description,title-suggestion` | Generate description with suggested title for manual copy | No      |
| `deferred-title,description`   | Generate description; only update title if inadequate     | No      |

**Notes:**

- `title` and `deferred-title` are mutually exclusive
- `title` and `title-suggestion` are mutually exclusive
- `title-suggestion` requires `description` to be included (the suggestion is embedded in the description)

**Note on `deferred-title`:** In this mode, Claude evaluates the existing PR title against conventional commit patterns and repository history. If the existing title is acceptable (follows conventions, has appropriate type/scope, accurately describes the changes), Claude will preserve it and only generate the description. This is useful when users have already entered a meaningful title that shouldn't be overwritten.

**Required Secrets:**

| Secret                    | Required                                      | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | Yes (unless `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set) | Anthropic API key for Claude access                                                                                                       |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | No (alternative to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)       | Claude Code OAuth token for authentication. When provided, takes precedence over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Generate with `claude setup-token`. |

**Authentication Methods:**

You can authenticate with Claude using either method:

1. **API Key (Traditional):** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your Anthropic API key
2. **OAuth Token (Pro/Max Users):** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with a token generated via `claude setup-token`

If both are provided, OAuth token takes precedence. At least one authentication method must be configured.

> **Important:** The [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) must be installed on your repository for these workflows to function. This is required by Anthropic's official Claude Code GitHub Action.
>
> **Note:** If you need assistance installing the Claude GitHub App, please open an issue at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Uniswap/ai-toolkit/issues).
>
> **Required permissions:** The caller workflow must include `id-token: write` permission (needed by Claude Code Action for ID token creation):
>
> ```yaml
> permissions:
>   contents: read
>   pull-requests: write
>   id-token: write
> ```

**Usage example (API Key):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_generate-pr-metadata.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  base_ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  generation_mode: 'description,title-suggestion'
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**Usage example (OAuth Token):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_generate-pr-metadata.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  base_ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  generation_mode: 'description,title-suggestion'
secrets:
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

**Usage example (Both - OAuth takes precedence):**

```yaml
uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/workflows/_generate-pr-metadata.yml@main
with:
  pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  base_ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  generation_mode: 'title,description'
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

**Prompt Configuration Options:**

The workflow determines which prompt to use in this priority order:

1. **`custom_prompt` input**: Explicit prompt text passed directly to the workflow
2. **`custom_prompt_path` input**: Path to a prompt file in the calling repository (default: `.github/prompts/generate-pr-title-description.md`)
3. **Default prompt from ai-toolkit**: Fetched from `Uniswap/ai-toolkit` repository (public, no authentication required)

### Autonomous Task Processing (`_claude-task-worker.yml`)

This workflow processes Linear issues autonomously using Claude Code. It's called by `claude-auto-tasks.yml` for each task in the matrix.

**Key Features:**

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7-Phase Workflow**         | Claude follows a structured approach: Understand → Explore → Plan → Implement → QA → Commit → Create PR  |
| **Autonomous Execution**     | Uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to run without permission prompts (safe in GitHub Actions sandbox) |
| **Turn Budget Management**   | Prompt includes explicit turn budgets per phase to prevent over-exploration and ensure PR creation       |
| **Fallback PR Creation**     | If Claude makes commits but fails to create a PR, workflow automatically creates a fallback PR           |
| **Debug Mode**               | Full Claude output shown by default (`debug_mode: true`) to understand reasoning                         |
| **Configurable PR Type**     | Choose between draft or published PRs via `pr_type` input (default: "draft")                             |
| **Task Complexity Warnings** | Warns about tasks containing keywords like "audit", "review", "investigate"                              |
| **Incremental Commits**      | Prompt instructs Claude to commit and push after each major piece of work to preserve progress           |
| **Linear Integration**       | Updates Linear issue status to "In Progress" when PR is created                                          |
| **Dual Authentication**      | Supports both API key and OAuth token authentication (OAuth takes precedence)                            |

2. **OAuth Token (Pro/Max Users):** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with a token generated via `claude setup-token`

If both are provided, OAuth token takes precedence. At least one authentication method must be configured.

> **Important:** The [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) must be installed on your repository for these workflows to function. This is required by Anthropic's official Claude Code GitHub Action.

**Turn Budget (built into prompt):**

| Phase              | Turns   | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Understand/Explore | 1-30    | Read CLAUDE.md, explore codebase, identify files |
| Plan/Implement     | 31-100  | Design approach and implement the solution       |
| QA/Fix             | 101-130 | Run checks, fix critical issues                  |
| **Commit/PR**      | 131-150 | **RESERVED** - Must commit and create PR         |

**Configuration:**

| Input                     | Default         | Description                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `model`                   | `claude-opus-5` | Claude model to use                             |
| `max_turns`               | `150`           | Maximum conversation turns                      |
| `debug_mode`              | `true`          | Show full Claude output                         |
| `timeout_minutes`         | `60`            | Job timeout                                     |
| `pr_type`                 | `draft`         | Type of PR to create: "draft" or "published"    |
| `install_uniswap_plugins` | `true`          | Auto-install uniswap plugins (false to opt out) |

**Validation Behavior:**

The workflow validates that Claude completed the task:

1. **No commits + No PR**: Job fails with "Task may be too complex, unclear, or require human judgment"
2. **Commits + No PR**: Fallback PR is automatically created to preserve work, job succeeds with warning
3. **Commits + PR**: Job succeeds, Linear updated to "In Progress"

**Job Summary Output:**

The job summary includes:

- Task title and Linear issue link
- Branch name and model used
- PR type (draft or published)
- Commit count
- PR creation status (✅ Claude PR / ⚠️ Fallback PR / ❌ No PR)
- Failure reason (if applicable)
- Linear status update

**Usage example (API Key):**

```yaml
uses: ./.github/workflows/_claude-task-worker.yml
with:
  issue_id: ${{ matrix.issue_id }}
  issue_identifier: ${{ matrix.issue_identifier }}
  issue_title: ${{ matrix.issue_title }}
  issue_description: ${{ matrix.issue_description }}
  issue_url: ${{ matrix.issue_url }}
  branch_name: ${{ matrix.branch_name }}
  target_branch: 'next'

```

### GitHub Actions Version Updater (`_update-action-versions-worker.yml`)

This workflow uses Claude Code to automatically update GitHub Actions to their latest versions. It runs weekly and creates PRs with version updates.

**Schedule:**

- **Frequency**: Every Monday at 5:00 AM Eastern Time (10:00 AM UTC)
- **Cron**: `0 10 * * 1`

**How It Works:**

1. Consumer workflow (`update-action-versions.yml`) creates an update branch
2. Calls the reusable worker (`_update-action-versions-worker.yml`)
3. Claude Code scans all workflow files for external actions pinned to SHAs
4. Queries GitHub API for latest releases and their commit SHAs
5. Updates outdated actions and creates a PR with a summary table

**Key Features:**

| Feature                      | Description                                                                   |

| **All Versions Updated**     | Updates to latest regardless of major/minor/patch                             |
| **Comprehensive PR**         | Creates PR with table showing all updates and changelog links                 |
| **Dry Run Mode**             | Can analyze without making changes                                            |
| **Fallback PR**              | Creates fallback PR if Claude commits but doesn't create PR                   |
| **Dual Authentication**      | Supports both API key and OAuth token authentication (OAuth takes precedence) |

```

### Shared Internal Workflows

These workflows are prefixed with two `__` and are only used within this repository:

- `publish-packages.yml` - **Unified package publishing workflow** (not a reusable workflow)
  - **Why unified?** npm OIDC trusted publishing validates the `workflow_ref` claim in the OIDC token, which contains the original trigger workflow (not the reusable workflow). This constraint requires all publishing to happen in a single workflow file that npm trusts.
  - **Two modes of operation:**
    - **Auto mode** (push to main/next): Detects affected packages via Nx, publishes with conventional/prerelease versioning, generates changelogs, sends Slack notifications
    - **Force mode** (manual workflow_dispatch): Publishes user-specified packages with prerelease versioning, useful for new packages or failed releases
  - Handles atomic versioning, npm publish with OIDC, git commit/tag push, and GitHub release creation
  - **Lockfile sync**: Automatically updates `bun.lock` when package versions are bumped to keep workspace dependencies in sync
  - **Workflow change detection**: Detects changes to reusable workflows (files prefixed with `_` in `.github/workflows/`). When workflow files change, the `next` branch is synced and Slack notifications are sent, even if no packages need publishing.

### Consumer Workflows

- `ci-pr-checks.yml` - Main PR validation pipeline
- `ci-check-pr-title.yml` - PR title format validation
- `claude-auto-tasks.yml` - Autonomous task processing from Linear (scheduled)
- `claude-code.yml` - Enables @claude mentions
- `claude-code-review.yml` - Automated code reviews via `@uniswap/review-cli`
- `claude-welcome.yml` - New PR welcomes
- `dev-ai-newsletter.yml` - Weekly Dev AI Pod newsletter generation (scheduled)
- `generate-pr-title-description.yml` - Auto-generated PR titles and descriptions
- `release-update-production.yml` - Production sync automation
- `update-action-versions.yml` - Automated GitHub Actions version updates (scheduled)

### Dev AI Newsletter (`dev-ai-newsletter.yml`)

This workflow automatically generates the Dev AI Pod weekly newsletter using Claude Code with MCP servers for Notion and Slack integration.

**Schedule:**

- **Frequency**: Every Monday at 9:00 AM EST (14:00 UTC)
- **Cron**: `0 14 * * 1`
- **Coverage**: Previous 7 days (Sunday to Saturday)

**How It Works:**

1. Calculates the date range (previous 7 days)
2. Refreshes Slack OAuth token inline (single-use refresh tokens are automatically rotated)
3. Creates MCP configuration for Notion and Slack servers
4. Claude reads the agent instructions from `.claude/agents/dev-ai-pod-weekly-newsletter.md`
5. Queries Notion databases for reading items and use cases
6. Queries Slack channels for engaging discussions
7. Queries GitHub releases for tool updates
8. Formats the newsletter following the template
9. Creates a new page in the Notion "Dev AI Weekly Newsletters" database

**Required Secrets:**

| Secret                | Required | Description                                       |

**Slack App Requirements:**

The Slack app needs these Bot Token Scopes:

- `channels:history` - View messages in public channels
- `channels:read` - View basic channel information
- `reactions:read` - Read emoji reactions
- `users:read` - View users and their basic information

**Notion Integration Requirements:**

The Notion integration needs access to:

- "📚 What We're Reading" database (read)
- "🌎 Real-World AI Use Cases" database (read)
- "Dev AI Weekly Newsletters" database (write)

**Configuration Inputs:**

| Input                    | Default           | Description                                                                                       |

**Manual Trigger:**

```bash
# Run with defaults (last 7 days)
gh workflow run dev-ai-newsletter.yml

# Dry run (generate but don't publish)
gh workflow run dev-ai-newsletter.yml -f dry_run=true

# Custom date range
gh workflow run dev-ai-newsletter.yml -f days_back=14

# Use Opus model for better quality
gh workflow run dev-ai-newsletter.yml -f model=claude-opus-5

# Post to specific Slack channels
gh workflow run dev-ai-newsletter.yml -f slack_post_channel_ids="C091XE1DNP2,C094URH6C13"
```

**MCP Servers Used:**

- `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server@1.9.1` - Official Notion MCP server (pinned to v1.9.1 due to breaking changes in v2.0.0)
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack` - Official Slack MCP server

> **Important: MCP Server Version Pinning**
>
> The Notion MCP server is pinned to v1.9.1 because v2.0.0 (released Dec 24, 2025) introduced breaking changes:
>
> - Tool names changed from `notion-*` to `API-*` format
> - Parameter format changed (e.g., `parent` must be an object, not a JSON string)
>
> The agent instructions in `.claude/agents/dev-ai-pod-weekly-newsletter.md` are written for v1.x API. To upgrade to v2.0.0, update both the version and the agent instructions.

**Artifacts:**

| Artifact Name                           | Condition    | Retention | Description                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `newsletter-preview-{start}-to-{end}`   | Dry run only | 30 days   | Formatted newsletter markdown for review |
| `claude-execution-log-{start}-to-{end}` | Always       | 7 days    | Claude execution log JSON for debugging  |

## Workflow Configuration

### Environment Variables

Workflows may define workflow-level environment variables for centralized configuration:

**Claude Code Review (`claude-code-review.yml`):**

```yaml
env:
  HAS_DATADOG_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY != '' }}
```

`secrets.*` is not a valid context in a step-level `if:`, and step-level `env:` is not applied before `if:` is evaluated. Job-level `env:` **is**, so this exposes "is Datadog configured?" to the optional CI Visibility step, which is skipped entirely when the secret is absent.

> **Note:** the `MAX_DIFF_LINES` repository variable is no longer read by `claude-code-review.yml`. Since that workflow moved to `@uniswap/review-cli`, diff-size policy comes from `.claude/review.yml` (`trivial_threshold`, set to `0` so every PR is reviewed) instead of a line-count cutoff. The variable is still consumed by external callers of the reusable `_claude-code-review.yml`, which accepts a `max_diff_lines` input, so **do not delete it**.

## Conventions

### Naming

- **External reusable workflows**: Prefix with `_` (underscore) - may be called from other repos
- **Internal shared workflows**: Prefix with `__` (double underscore prefix)
- **Consumer workflows**: No prefix, descriptive kebab-case names
- **Example workflows**: Numbered prefix (e.g., `01-`, `02-`)

### Structure

All workflows follow consistent patterns:

1. **Concurrency control**: Prevent duplicate runs
2. **Security**: Explicit permissions, Bullfrog scanning
3. **Error handling**: Fail fast with clear messages
4. **Caching**: NPM dependencies, Nx computation cache
5. **Artifacts**: Store important outputs

### Repository Variables

Version pinning is centralized using GitHub repository variables (`vars.*`):

| Variable       | Value     | Purpose                                    |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `NODE_VERSION` | `22.21.1` | Node.js version for all workflows          |
| `NPM_VERSION`  | `11.7.0`  | npm version (required for OIDC publishing) |

**Usage in workflows:**

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@...
  with:
    node-version: ${{ vars.NODE_VERSION }}

- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@<sha> # vX.Y.Z
  with:
    bun-version: '1.3.12'

- run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Publish job only (OIDC trusted publishing requires npm CLI):
- run: npm install -g npm@${{ vars.NPM_VERSION }}
```

**To update versions:** Change the repository variables in GitHub Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables. All workflows will automatically use the new values.

### Secrets

Common secrets referenced:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude AI API authentication (also requires the [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) to be installed on the repository). Alternative: use `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` instead.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` - Claude Code OAuth token for authentication (alternative to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Generate with `claude setup-token`. For Pro/Max users.
- `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` - NPM registry authentication (for publishing `@uniswap` scoped packages)
- `WORKFLOW_PAT` - Personal Access Token with `repo` scope for: (1) pushing commits/tags in force-publish, (2) cross-repo access to fetch default prompts from ai-toolkit in `_claude-code-review.yml` and `_generate-pr-metadata.yml`, (3) resolving review threads via GraphQL API in `_claude-code-review.yml` (the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks permissions for the `resolveReviewThread` mutation). **Important:** The account that owns the PAT must have write, maintain, or admin access to the repository for thread resolution to work.
- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` - GPG key for signed commits/tags
- `LINEAR_API_KEY` - Linear API authentication (for autonomous tasks)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack notifications
- `NOTION_API_KEY` - Notion integration token (for newsletter automation)
- `SLACK_REFRESH_TOKEN` - Slack OAuth refresh token (for newsletter automation, auto-rotated)
- `SLACK_REFRESH_URL` - Slack token refresh backend URL (optional, has default)
- `SLACK_TEAM_ID` - Slack workspace team ID (for newsletter automation)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Built-in token (automatic)

## Usage Patterns

### Calling Reusable Workflows

External reusable workflows (prefixed with `_`):

```yaml
jobs:
  call-claude:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/_claude-main.yml
    with:
      model: 'claude-sonnet-5'
      allowed_tools: 'read-write'
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

**Note**: `publish-packages.yml` is NOT a reusable workflow. It's a unified workflow triggered directly by push events and workflow_dispatch. See [Architecture: Publish Workflow](#architecture-publish-workflow) for details.

### Triggering Workflows

- **On PR**: `ci-pr-checks.yml`, `claude-welcome.yml`, `ci-check-pr-title.yml`, `generate-pr-title-description.yml`
- **On Push to main/next**: `publish-packages.yml` (auto mode)
- **On Issue Comment**: `claude-code.yml` (when @claude mentioned)
- **Manual Dispatch**: `release-update-production.yml`, `claude-code-review.yml`, `publish-packages.yml` (force mode)

### Force Publishing Packages

Use `publish-packages.yml` with `workflow_dispatch` to manually publish packages when:

- New packages haven't had code changes detected by Nx release
- A previous release partially failed
- You need to republish a specific package

```bash
# Publish a single package
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml \
  -f packages="@uniswap/ai-toolkit-nx-claude"

# Publish multiple packages
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml \
  -f packages="@uniswap/ai-toolkit-nx-claude,@uniswap/ai-toolkit-notion-publisher"

# Publish all release-configured packages
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml \
  -f packages="all"

# Dry run (no actual publish)
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml \
  -f packages="all" \
  -f dryRun="true"
```

**Note**: Force publishing only runs on the `next` branch and publishes with the `next` npm tag using prerelease versioning.

- **On Schedule**: `claude-auto-tasks.yml` (daily at 5am EST), `update-action-versions.yml` (weekly on Mondays at 5am ET)
- **Manual Dispatch**: `release-update-production.yml`, `claude-code-review.yml`, `claude-auto-tasks.yml`, `update-action-versions.yml`

## Architecture: Publish Workflow

The publishing functionality is consolidated into a single unified workflow due to npm OIDC trusted publishing constraints:

### Why a Unified Workflow?

npm OIDC trusted publishing validates the `workflow_ref` claim in the OIDC token. When a reusable workflow is called:

- `workflow_ref` = the **caller** workflow (e.g., `ci-publish-packages.yml`)
- `job_workflow_ref` = the **reusable** workflow (e.g., `publish-packages.yml`)

npm validates against `workflow_ref`, not `job_workflow_ref`. This means the caller workflow must be configured as a trusted workflow in npm, not the reusable workflow. To avoid configuring multiple workflows in npm, all publishing logic is consolidated into a single workflow file.

### workflow_dispatch Inputs (Force Mode)

| Input      | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `packages` | string  | Comma-separated npm package names, or "all" for all packages |
| `dryRun`   | boolean | Simulate without publishing (default: false)                 |

**Note**: Force mode only works on the `next` branch and always uses prerelease versioning with the `next` npm tag.

### Smart Prerelease Versioning Algorithm

When `version_strategy` is set to `prerelease`, the workflow uses a **smart versioning algorithm** that ensures `next` versions are always properly aligned with `latest` versions. This prevents version misalignment issues (e.g., `latest=0.5.0` but `next=0.3.0-next.5`).

**Algorithm (Option A: base = latest + patch bump):**

1. **Get `latest` from npm**: Query npm for the package's `latest` dist-tag version. Default to `0.0.0` if the package hasn't been published yet.

2. **Calculate base version**: Bump the patch version by 1. For example:

   - `latest = 0.5.0` → `base = 0.5.1`
   - `latest = 1.2.3` → `base = 1.2.4`
   - Not published → `base = 0.0.1`

3. **Find highest existing prerelease on npm**: Query npm for all versions matching `{base}-{preid}.*` pattern and find the highest prerelease number.

4. **Find highest existing prerelease in git tags**: Search git tags for `{package}@{base}-{preid}.*` and find the highest prerelease number.

5. **Calculate new version**: `MAX(npm_prerelease, git_prerelease) + 1`

**Example:**

```text
Package: @uniswap/my-package
Latest on npm: 0.5.0
Existing next versions: 0.5.1-next.0, 0.5.1-next.1, 0.5.1-next.2
Git tags: @uniswap/my-package@0.5.1-next.0, @uniswap/my-package@0.5.1-next.1

Result: 0.5.1-next.3
```

**Why this approach?**

- **Prevents misalignment**: `next` versions always build on top of `latest`, never behind it
- **Handles orphaned versions**: Considers both npm and git tags to avoid version conflicts
- **Resilient to failures**: Even if a publish fails partway, the next attempt will calculate the correct version
- **Semver compliant**: Follows semantic versioning rules for prereleases

### Smart Stable Versioning Algorithm

When `version_strategy` is set to `conventional` (main branch), the workflow uses a **smart stable versioning algorithm** that handles edge cases like prerelease versions being incorrectly published to the `latest` tag.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Get `latest` from npm**: Query npm for the package's `latest` dist-tag version. If not published, start at `0.0.1`.

2. **Strip prerelease suffix**: If the latest version has a prerelease suffix (e.g., `0.0.2-next.5`), strip it to get the base version (`0.0.2`).

3. **Check if base version exists**: If the latest was a prerelease, check if the base version already exists on npm or as a git tag.

4. **Graduate or bump**:
   - If base version doesn't exist → use it (the prerelease "graduates" to stable)
   - If base version exists → find highest stable patch on npm/git and bump by 1

**Example 1 - Graduating from prerelease:**

```text
Package: @uniswap/my-package
Latest on npm: 0.0.2-next.5 (incorrectly published)
Base version 0.0.2 exists on npm: NO

Result: 0.0.2 (graduates from prerelease)
```

**Example 2 - Normal patch bump:**

```text
Package: @uniswap/my-package
Latest on npm: 0.5.18
Highest stable patch: 0.5.18

Result: 0.5.19
```

**Why this approach?**

- **Handles recovery**: If prerelease versions were incorrectly published to `latest`, the algorithm recovers by graduating to the correct stable version
- **Consistent with prerelease algorithm**: Uses the same npm/git checking strategy
- **No Nx release dependency**: Doesn't rely on `nx release version` which can misinterpret prerelease versions

## Development Guidelines

### Script Separation Policy (CRITICAL)

Complex bash scripting (50+ lines, API calls, etc.) MUST be extracted to `.github/scripts/`:

❌ **BAD**: 200 lines of inline bash in YAML
✅ **GOOD**: Call standalone script: `./.github/scripts/my-script.sh`

For reusable tools, publish as npm packages (e.g., `@uniswap/ai-toolkit-notion-publisher`).

### Action Pinning (CRITICAL)

Always pin external actions to **specific commit hashes** with version comments:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
```

Never use tags or branch names directly.

### Bullfrog Security Scanning (CRITICAL)

**Every job running on non-macOS runners MUST have `bullfrogsec/bullfrog` as the FIRST step** - no exceptions.

This applies to ALL jobs, including:

- Main workflow jobs (build, test, deploy)
- Pre-check jobs (validation, detection)
- Summary jobs (status reporting, skip notifications)
- Any job that runs on `ubuntu-latest` or similar Linux runners

**✅ CORRECT - Bullfrog as first step:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: bullfrogsec/bullfrog@1831f79cce8ad602eef14d2163873f27081ebfb3 # v0.8.4

      - name: Do something
        run: echo "This step comes after Bullfrog"
```

**❌ WRONG - Missing Bullfrog or not first:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Do something # ❌ Bullfrog must be first!
        run: echo "Missing security scanning"
```

**Why this matters:**

- Bullfrog provides egress security scanning for all workflow jobs
- Semgrep code review automatically flags missing Bullfrog steps
- Even "trivial" jobs that only echo status messages need security scanning
- This is enforced by automated code review and will block PR approval

**Checklist for new workflow jobs:**

- [ ] Is the job on a non-macOS runner?
- [ ] Is `bullfrogsec/bullfrog` the FIRST step?
- [ ] Is it pinned to the correct SHA with version comment?

### Static Refs in `uses:` Field (CRITICAL)

**The `uses:` field in GitHub Actions requires STATIC strings at workflow parse time.**

Dynamic interpolation via `${{ inputs.* }}`, `${{ github.* }}`, or environment variables is **explicitly disallowed** for security and predictability reasons. The workflow YAML is parsed and validated before any job runs, so variables are not yet available when `uses:` is evaluated.

**❌ WRONG - This will FAIL:**

```yaml
# This looks like it would work, but GitHub Actions rejects it at parse time
- uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/actions/build-plugin-config@${{ inputs.some_ref }}
```

**✅ CORRECT - Pin to a full SHA:**

```yaml
- name: Build plugin configuration
  id: build-plugins
  uses: Uniswap/ai-toolkit/.github/actions/build-plugin-config@bc20d5cb11941235a629ccd7e296eb6d8a4a2028 # pinned to next
  with:
    install_uniswap_plugins: ${{ inputs.install_uniswap_plugins }}
    exclude_plugins: ${{ inputs.exclude_plugins }}
```

**Why this constraint exists:**

- **Security**: Prevents injection attacks where malicious input could change which action is executed; full SHAs satisfy org-level pinning policies
- **Predictability**: GitHub validates the action reference exists before running any workflow code
- **Caching**: GitHub can pre-fetch actions before job execution begins

**This constraint applies to:**

- External actions: `uses: owner/repo/.github/actions/action@ref`
- Reusable workflows: `uses: owner/repo/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@ref`
- Local actions/workflows: `uses: ./.github/actions/action` (no ref, always local)

### Reusable Workflow Permissions (CRITICAL)

When calling reusable workflows via `uses:`, permissions defined in the reusable workflow's job are **NOT automatically inherited**. The **caller workflow** must explicitly define all required permissions.

**This is especially critical for npm OIDC trusted publishing**, which requires `id-token: write`:

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish packages
    permissions:
      id-token: write # Required for npm OIDC trusted publishing
      contents: write
      packages: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    uses: ./.github/workflows/_some-reusable-workflow.yml
    with:
      # ... inputs
```

Without `id-token: write` in the caller, npm publish will fail with:

```text
403 Forbidden - You may not perform that action with these credentials.
```

**Note**: `publish-packages.yml` is NOT a reusable workflow—it defines its own permissions directly. This is intentional due to npm OIDC constraints (see [Architecture: Publish Workflow](#architecture-publish-workflow)).

## Testing Workflows

### Local Testing

Use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test workflows locally:

```bash
act pull_request -j ci-pr-checks
```

### Workflow Dispatch

Many workflows support manual triggering via GitHub UI or CLI:

```bash
gh workflow run claude-code-review.yml \
  -f pr_number=123 \
  -f model="claude-sonnet-5"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**: Check concurrency groups and trigger conditions
2. **Permission denied**: Verify `permissions:` block in workflow
3. **Secret not found**: Ensure secret is defined in repository settings
4. **Action version mismatch**: Check commit hash is correct

### Debugging

Enable debug logging:

```bash
# Set repository secret
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true
```
